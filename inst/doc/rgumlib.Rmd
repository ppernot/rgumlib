`rgumlib` is a set of R functions designed to perform 
uncertainty propagation according to the 
_GUM_^[[GUM](http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/documents/jcgm/JCGM_100_2008_F.pdf)] 
and 
_GUM-Supp1_^[[GUM-Supp1](http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/documents/jcgm/JCGM_101_2008_E.pdf)] 
recommendations.

The package implements also various plotting functions, and tools for sensitivity analysis.

# Other packages

`propagate`

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE, comment = "#>")
library(rgumlib)
# set.seed(1234) # Initialise la graine du RNG
```

# Problem setup

Let us consider the following linear model as an example:
$$Y = X_1 + X_2$$
where $X_1$ and $X_2$ are two uncertain variables to be defined.

## Model definition

The model can be defined as an expression or a function. 
The difference is that analytic derivatives will be used 
for expressions, whereas functions require numerical derivatives. 
In all the examples we have been able to treat,
this is not a choice criterion (no difference observed). 

```{r}
# Expression analytique du modele
fExpr = expression( x1 + 2*x2 )
# or
fExpr = function(x1,x2) x1 + 2*x2 
```

In practice, use of a function enables more complex models, 
for instance calls to external codes.

__Warning__: the only arguments of the function should be the 
uncertain variables and bear the same names as those used to 
define these variables (see below).

## Input variables definition

### GUM

To apply the combination of variances, one needs each variables 
to be characterized by its mean value and variance or standard 
uncertainty.

For an easier and more foolproof coding, we use the following
convention:

* the mean value is stored in the variable, e.g. `x1`

* the standard uncertainty has the name of the variable extended by '.u', 
  e.g. `x1.u`

```{r, tidy=FALSE}
# Variables incertaines
x1 = 1; x1.u = 0.1
x2 = 1; x2.u = 0.1 
```


### GUM-Supp1

For the combination of distributions, one needs to specify additional information: the probability density function (extension '.pdf'), and
eventually the  umber of degrees of freedom (extension '.df').

```{r, tidy=FALSE}
# Variables incertaines
x1.pdf = "norm"
x2.pdf = "stud"; x2.df = 5 
```

#### Available distributions

In order to ensure inputs compatibility between the _GUM_ and _GUM-Supp1_
functions, the distributions are parameterized by their mean value $x.mu$ 
and standard deviation $x.u$ (and if required by an additional 
_degrees of freedom_ $x.df$). 
For instance, the boundaries of the uniform distribution are computed 
from $x.mu$ and $x.u$: $x_{min}=x.mu-x.u*\sqrt{3}$ and $x_{max}=x.mu+x.u*\sqrt{3}$.   

`arcsine` 
  : Arcsine derivative

`delta`
  : Dirac $\delta$ distribution, mainly used to fix temporarily the value of
    a variable for sensitivity analysis, or to pass constants to the model.
    Variables with null variance should be graciously filtered out by 
    `rgumlib` UP and SA routines.
    
`lnorm` 
  : Lognormal

`norm`
  : Normal

`stud`  
  : Student's _t_

`tnorm`
  : Truncated normal (positive values)

`triangle` 
  : Symmetric triangular

`unif`  
  : Uniform

### Non-independent variables



## Data gathering

The naming convention exposed above is used to permit
an automatic collect of information. 

The function `collectParams(fff)' searches the environment for
the mean values, standard uncertainties, etc... of the variables
appearing in the definition of its first argument (an expression or
a function). It returns a list containing the gathered information.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Collect parameters in environment
params = collectParams(fExpr)
str(params)
```


# Uncertainty propagation

This section presents the functions used to perform 
uncertainty propagation according to the GUM and its Supplement 1.

## GUM

The combination of variances is done withe the function `gumCV()`.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
G=with(params, 
       gumCV(fExpr=fExpr,x.mu=x.mu,x.u=x.u,silent=FALSE)
       )
```

This function returns a list 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
str(G)
```

A nicer version of the budget table can be obtained using 
table printing functions, _e.g._ `kable`

```{r, echo=TRUE}
knitr::kable(G$budget)
```

## GUM-Supp1

The propagation of distributions is generally performed by a
numerical approach. The GUM-Supp1 recommends the Monte Carlo
algorithm.  

One can generate a predefined number of samples, but it is
recommended to use an adaptive algorithm to ensure the 
convergence of statistics of interest. In the first case,
the user specifies the number of runs, and no convergence
check is performed

```{r, echo=TRUE}
S=with(params, 
       gumS1(fExpr=fExpr,x.mu=x.mu,x.u=x.u,x.pdf=x.pdf,x.df=x.df,
             adapt=FALSE, nrun=1000)
       )
```

Otherwise, the user specifies the statistics to converge
(typically a standard deviation or a 95 % confidence interval)
and the number of significant digits required.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
S=with(params, 
       gumS1(fExpr=fExpr,x.mu=x.mu,x.u=x.u,x.pdf=x.pdf,x.df=x.df,
             adapt=TRUE,ndig=1)
       )
```

The adaptive algorithm proposed in the GUM-Supp1 and implemented
in `gumS1()` has been shown to present several shortcomings,
notably to stop too early. The convergence test is based on an
enlargement factor 2 which is too small for small block numbers
at the beginning of the procedure  (step _k_/ in the algorithm
of Section 7.9.4 in GUM-Supp1). Globally, this adaptive
algorithm has only 80 % success in predicting 95 % intervals
containing the true value. Another problem is that the estimation
of the numerical tolerance $\delta$ from $u(Y)$ is biased for
small block sizes (step _j_/ of algorithm).

The first problem can be partially solved by replacing the 
enlargement factor 2 by a Student's $t$ factor $t_{0.975}(h-1)$,
where $h$ is the number of blocks. This upgrades the success
percentage to 91 %, and has been implemented by default in the
`gumS1()` function.

Another adaptive procedure based on Stein's two stages method has
been implemented in `gumS2()`. This method has a success of 95 %
^[WÃ¼bbeler et al. (2010) Metrologia 47:317].
The two stages are:

1 generate a small number of blocks $h_{1}$
 
2 estimate the number of missing blocks to reach the 95 %
  success target 
  $$h_{2}=\max\left(\left\lfloor \frac{\left(s_{y}(h_{1})*t_{0.975}(h_{1}-1)\right)^{2}}{\delta^{2}}\right\rfloor -h_{1}+1,\,0\right)$$
 
 
```{r, echo=TRUE}
S=with(params, 
       gumS2(fExpr=fExpr,x.mu=x.mu,x.u=x.u,x.pdf=x.pdf,x.df=x.df,
             ndig=1)
       )
```

### Diagnostics


```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.show = "hold", fig.cap = "Graphical summaries of Monte Carlo samples: (left) cumulative statstics; (right) empirical cumulative distribution."}
cumPlot(S$Y,cex=0.5)
ECIPlot(S$Y,cex=0.5)
```

# Presentation of results

To present the final results, the GUM advises to preserve 
2 significant digits on the uncertainty and to round the 
mean value accordingly. Helper functions are proposed
to print the results, also as coverage intervals.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
uncPrint(y=G$y.mu,uy=G$y.u)
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
CIPrint(y=G$y.mu,uy=G$y.u,fac=1.96,p=0.95)
```

# Sensitivity Analysis


## Analysis of variance

For independent input variables, the ANOVA column of the
uncertainty budget produced by `gumCV()` provides all the
required information for SA. 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
G$anova
```

Let us call $S_i$ the relative contribution of variable 
$X_i$ to the variance of $Y$. Then, a variation of $p$ %
of the variance of $X_i$ induces a variation of $S_i*p$ %
of $Y$ variance. This result (exact for linear models) 
enables to assess the effect of each variable on $Y$ and 
to target the variables to improve in order to reach a 
desired variance for $Y$. 


## Inputs-output correlation

Samples from input variables and output can be used directly to
calculate sensitivity indices. Scatterplots of the samples
can be particularly informative, but do not provide numerical
values.

The correlation coefficients $\mathrm{cor}(Y,X_{i})$ between $Y$ and the inputs $\mathbf{X}$ can be easily evaluated.

For a linear model, one has
$$\mathrm{cor}(Y,X_{i})=\sum_{j=1}^{k}\left(\frac{\partial Y}{\partial X_{j}}\right)_{\overline{x}}\frac{u(x_{j})}{u(y)}\mathrm{cor}(X_{i},X_{j})$$
For independent input variables, this simplifies to
$$\mathrm{cor}^{2}(Y,X_{i})=\frac{\left(\frac{\partial Y}{\partial X_{i}}\right)_{\overline{x}}^{2}u^{2}(x_{i})}{u^{2}(y)}\equiv ANOVA_{i}$$

Therefore, for linear models and independent variables, the
correlation coefficients are directly related to the ANOVA.

This cannot be directly extended to nonlinear models, but using
rank correlation coefficients (Spearman) instead of Person's 
enable good results with monotonous functions.

One has also to remember that null correlation coefficients
do not imply an absence of dependence between variables.

The function `SAPlot()` generates a matrix plot with both
scatterplots and correlation coefficients. 

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.cap = "Inputs-output scatterplots and correlations."}
SAPlot(cbind(S$X,S$Y),cex=0.5)
```

The correlation coefficients can be obtained in base R:
```{r, echo=TRUE}
(CorP = cor(S$X,S$Y, method = "pearson"))
cor(S$X,S$Y, method = "spearman")
```

## Sobol indices

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.show = "hold"}
z=with(params,
       sobolSA(fExpr=fExpr,x.mu=x.mu,x.u=x.u,x.pdf=x.pdf,x.df=x.df,
               graph=TRUE,cex=0.5)
       )
print(z)
```

## Variance gradients

Variance gradients^[Campanelli _et al._ (2013) _Meas. Sci. Tech._ 
__24__:025002] are calculated from the samples for independent
$\mathbf{X}$ and $Y$. They require the additional evaluation 
of partial derivatives for each point of the sample.

$$G_{i}=\frac{E\left[\left(Y-\overline{y}\right)\frac{\partial Y}
        {\partial X_{i}}\left(X_{i}-\overline{x}_{i}\right)\right]}
        {u^{2}(y)}$$

```{r, echo=TRUE}
d= vgSA(fExpr=fExpr,x.mu=params$x.mu, x.u=params$x.u, 
        X=S$X, Y=S$Y, silent=TRUE)
knitr::kable(d$budget)
```

These indices are interpreted as follows: a variation of $p$ % 
of the variance of $X_i$ induces a variation of $G_i*p$ % of 
$Y$ variance. Except for linear models, where one recovers the
ANOVA $G_{i}=ANOVA_{i}$, this interpretation is valid for small
values of $p$. This is to be contrasted with other indices, such 
as Sobol's, which quantify the effect on $Y$  of a cancellation
of the input's variance.

An originality of variance gradients indices is that , for
non-linear models, they can be negative. In such cases, reducing
the variance of a variable might induce an increase in the
variance of $Y$.

## Note

For linear models with independent variables, one can check
that the sensitivity indices returned by the ANOVA, Sobol and VG
methods are consistent with the square of the correlation
coefficients (Pearson): 
```{r, echo=TRUE}
signif(CorP^2,3)
```

# Consolidated example: sum of squares

One considers a quadratic model which presents a series of 
traps for UP-SA
$$Y = X_1^2 + X_2^2$$
with $X_1 \sim Norm(\mu=0,\sigma=1)$ and $X_2 \sim Norm(\mu=0,\sigma=0.1)$.
This is a case where the _GUM_ is inappropriate (non linear term), 
and where the  inputs-output correlation SA method fails 
(non-monotonous symmetric response).
